Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) does not store data in Amazon S3 or Amazon EBS. Instead, Amazon EFS is a standalone, fully managed file storage service that stores data across multiple Availability Zones within an AWS Region

Here's a brief comparison to clarify:

- **Amazon EFS**: Provides scalable file storage for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It stores data redundantly across multiple Availability Zones for high availability and durability
- **Amazon S3**: An object storage service designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is ideal for storing unstructured data like backups, archives, and big data
- **Amazon EBS**: Provides block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. It is designed for workloads that require persistent, low-latency storage

Each of these services is optimized for different use cases, so the choice depends on your specific storage needs.

### Amazon EBS
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block storage volumes that can be attached to Amazon EC2 instances. These volumes are raw block devices, meaning you can format them with any file system you choose. Common file systems used with EBS volumes include:

- **ext4**: Commonly used in Linux environments.
- **XFS**: Known for high performance and scalability, also used in Linux.
- **NTFS**: Typically used in Windows environments.

You can format and mount an EBS volume with the file system that best suits your application's needs[1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/what-is-ebs.html).

### Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service, which means it stores data as objects within buckets. Unlike block storage, S3 does not use traditional file systems. Instead, it uses a flat namespace to store objects, each identified by a unique key. This allows for scalable and flexible storage of large amounts of unstructured data[2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-using-volumes.html)[3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html).
